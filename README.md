# MinimalistBlockTrees

This repository contains an fork of [Manuel Ariel CÃ¡ceres Reyes'](https://github.com/elarielcl)
implementation for the BlockTree data structure described [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7149265).
Details of the implementation follow the experimental studies
conducted in Reyes' MSc. thesis available [here](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/mem/algoritmos/tesisManuel.pdf).

## Installation Guide

First clone the repo:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/elarielcl/MinimalistBlockTrees.git
```

This project is a CMake project.
To build this project with some runnables you should do

```bash
cd MinimalistBlockTrees
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake .. # Issue: second cmake necessary to compile sdsl
make
```

You can add an executable by writing your file in the `executables` directory
and add its name to the `executables/CMakeLists.txt` file,
this adds the necessary libraries for you:

```cpp
set(project_EXECUTABLES
        <new_executable>
        main)
...
```

### Commitlint

To use the commitlint config, make sure to run

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage Example

Let's suppose we want to build a BlockTree, so we do:

```cpp
...
std::string input = "AACCCTGCTGCTGATCGGATCGTAGC";
int r = 2; //The arity of the BlockTree
int ll = 16; // The length of the strings represented by the leaves of the BlockTree

BlockTree* bt = new BlockTree(input, r, mll); // This creates the BlockTree object, a pointer-based implementation
bt->process_back_pointers(); // This method builds the BackPointers in the BlockTree
bt->clean_unnecessary_expansions(); // This method removes the expansion of InternalBlocks that are unnecesary (this is also called pruning)
 ...
```

In case you want to build the a more compact version
but without theoretical guarantee, you can replace the last two lines with

```cpp
bt->process_back_pointers_heuristic();
```

.. now you have a proper BlockTree answering access queries(`bt->access(i)`),
if you want to give it `bt->rank(c,i) & bt->select(c,j)` support you should do:

```cpp
for (int c: characters)
    bt->add_rank_select_support(c);
```

The above is a pointer-based implementation of BlockTrees,
if you want to have a more compact representation
(using bitvectors to represent the tree) you should do:

```cpp
...
CBlockTree *cbt = new CBlockTree(bt); // Builds a more compact BlockTree representation
cbt->access(i);
cbt->select(c,i);
cbt->size(); // It obtains the size (in bytes) of this compact representation
cbt->serialize(out); // It serializes it components to an output stream
...
CBlockTree *loaded_cbt = new CBlockTree(in); // It loads a CBlockTree from an input stream
...
```

If your input is a bitmap
you can build an (even) more compact representation specialized for bitmaps:

```cpp
...
CBitBlockTree *cbbt = new CBitBlockTree(bt, '('); // It assumes that the BlockTree represents a bitmap whose "1"
                                                  //is the second argument of the contruction, the rest are "0"s
cbbt->access(i);
cbbt->rank_1(i);
cbbt->select_0(i);
...
...
```

... and never forget to delete your trash ;)

```cpp
...
delete bt;
delete cbt;
delete loaded_cbt;
delete cbbt;
...
```
